**Lab Implementation Overview:**

We will implement a **multi-tier real infrastructure scenario** using **Terraform**.  

The lab will be divided into smaller, manageable parts, and each part will be deployed step by step:

- **Remote State Storage** and **Key Vault** for Secret Management

- **Network Peering** to connect all environments seamlessly using **Terraform**  


# Implementing Lab in Multiple Ways

- Deploying code using Az-CLI session and saving state file on the local filesystem.
- Parameterizing the lab using input and output variables.
- Modularizing the code and deploying the lab using a local module.
- Using Terraform registry module for the lab.
- Reusing the code and deploying multiple environments using workspaces and directories method.
- Deploying the lab using a service principal account.
- Deploying the lab again using Key Vault for secrets.
- Implementing remote state storage on Azure Blob Storage.

Apart from that, you will learn about:
- Dependency graph
- Implicit and explicit dependency

  # Planned Lab Modifications and Integrations

- I will modify the lab to work with Azure DevOps and Azure Cloud.
- I will integrate the lab with GitHub.
- I will create a service connection between Azure DevOps and GitHub.
- I will set up a service connection between Azure DevOps and Azure Cloud using a Service Principal (SP) account.
- I will create a pipeline in Azure DevOps to deploy the code on Azure Cloud.
